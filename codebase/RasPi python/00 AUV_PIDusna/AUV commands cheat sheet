Raw Serial Commands.
Entry into Python interface(s) will make a lot of this transparent and perform calculations to simplify user experience.

Movement
	sto:000		stops all controllers.
				xyz can be anything, convention is 000
	rol:xyz		xyz=[0,360] degrees
					xyz=999 stops pitch controller
					[801,807] left/right
	pit:xyz		xyz=[0,360] degrees
					xyz=999 stops pitch controller
					[811,817] nose down/up
	dep:xyz		xyz=[0,820] cm
					xyz=999 stops depth controller
					[821,827] up/down
	hea:xyz		xyz=[000,360] degrees
					xyz=999 stops heading controller, 
					[831,837] left/right
	vel:xyz		xyz=[0,800] ms PWM represents [1.1,1.9]ms
					xyz=999 stops speed controller
					[841,847] speed decrease/increase
	off:xyz		xyz=[0,360] degrees
					xyz=999 stops heading offset
					[851,857] offset left/right

Gains
	format: xy * 10^(z-5)
	Heading
		hkp:xyz
		hki:xyz
		hkd:xyz
	Depth
		dkp:xyz
		dki:xyz
		dkd:xyz
	Pitch
		pkp:xyz
		pki:xyz
		pkd:xyz


BNO
	pos:00x		x[0,7], changes BNO programmed orientation (see datasheet)

Press Sensor
	zero:000	zeroize / sets atmospheric pressure to current reading
				xyz can be anything, convention is 000

mBed
	res:000		resets mBed
				xyz can be anything, convention 000

	tst:xyz		performed preset movements
				just ignore this shit... i dont remember how it works and it's no longer useful
				x: mode
					0	runs for 3s in each direction (y can be anything)
					1	runs indefinitely in specified direction
				y: direction
				z: movement
